Ayy, this seems pretty interesting!

{% highlight python %}
hello world!
{% endhighlight %}

Just setup the blog using Jekyll. Turns out its pretty convenient. Hopefully will continue to update this blog, though I find that very hard.

One of the reasons why I want to get back to blogging is that I think lately I have been struggling to formulize what I want to say. While I would say my English isn't bad, but it gets on my nerves when I try to explain something complicated. I keep repeating myself and the conversation doesn't really progress.

Anyhow, let's see how this attempt goes. GG bros.
